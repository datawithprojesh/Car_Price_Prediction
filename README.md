# Car Price Prediction Model

## Project Description
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices using historical sales data.

## Purpose
The Car Price Prediction Model is designed to estimate the selling price of cars based on various influencing factors derived from historical data. The purpose is to aid buyers and sellers in the automotive industry by providing a fair estimation of a car's market value.

## Data Overview
The project utilizes a dataset that includes features like 'Year', 'Selling_Price', 'Present_Price', 'Kms_Driven', 'Fuel_Type', 'Seller_Type', 'Transmission', and 'Owner'. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed for model training.

## Goals
- To perform comprehensive EDA to understand the impact of different features on car prices.
- To preprocess the data, making it suitable for feeding into a machine learning model.
- To build and train a model that can accurately predict the price of a car.

## Achievements
- Successfully loaded and inspected the dataset.
- Conducted preliminary data analysis, including handling of missing values and statistical summary.
- Selected relevant features for the predictive model.

## Usage
To use the model:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and make predictions.
